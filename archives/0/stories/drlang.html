<p><b>Riley:</b> A few weeks ago, our editor Katrina showed me a free indie game called Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and the Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist. I am not a gamer, so I was initially suspicious, but after playing it I wouldn’t really describe this as a “game.” It’s more of… an interactive story? a standup routine? fifteen minutes of confusion, narrated by an excitable British guy? </p>

<p><b>Katrina:</b> Games are great media for telling stories. The best games out there wouldn’t be so great without a well written story - just like movies.</p>

<p><b>Riley:</b> I wanted to share this charming and bizarre experience with others, so I asked other Lacewing contributors to play through the game and write reviews of their own. </p>

<p><b>Cody:</b> This game has the excitement and suspense element that horror games do without any actual lasting scariness. It's sort of like a kitten at that age where they start to run fast and destroy things, nervewrackingly erratic while simultaneously staying funny, cute, and fundamentally harmless. I found the concept refreshingly creative, and it's always awesome to see people using games as a medium for non-combat-based interactive storytelling.</p>

<p><b>Katrina:</b> Dr. Langeskov is a lightning-fast interactive novella, recently released for free on the video game aggregator Steam. Co-creator of hit meta-game/bizarro art project The Stanley Parable, William Pugh released a beta version of this accurately titled “Whirlwind Heist” on December 4. Dr. Langeskov puts you in the shoes of a seasoned mastermind thief, poised on the edge of the greatest robbery in history. The opening act is plagued with some pretty strange bugs (including one really odd audio glitch during an elevator sequence), but this game’s high-adrenaline car chases and breathtaking sunset vistas put Dr. Langeskov in my list of this year’s top 5 indie games, even in its unfinished state. Look out for the finished version of Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist sometime in spring 2016.</p>

<p><b>Riley: </b>I was happy to get some responses for my request for game reviews, but both Cody and Katrina have experience playing PC games (Katrina’s review was also totally fake). In my mind, the true test of a work of art is to show it to someone unfamiliar with the format, so I decided the only course of action was to show the game to a true no0b… my grandfather. </p>

<p><b>Riley:</b> Papa, what did you think of the game?</p>

<p><b>Riley’s Grandfather Pat:</b> Well that was intriguing. Very intriguing. I’m not a game person, like you said, but thank you for showing it to me. Absorbing, interesting, very involved.  I liked it a lot.  Obviously I’m not very good at moving around… what do you call it? The W-A-S-B-N-D? But nicely done, thank you for the introduction.</p>

<p><b>Jane [Riley’s aunt, from across the room]:</b> Can you show me this Internet game you’re showing everybody? </p>

<p><b>Riley: </b>What did you think of the game, Jane? </p>

<p><b>Jane:</b> I liked it better than I thought I would. &nbsp;I did wonder how many scenarios there were, like how many infinite combinations of movements would there be? Or actually, is it directing you so specifically… [makes funnel motion with hands] &nbsp;...if you had gone around and hit random stuff, what would have happened next?<b><br></b></p><p><b>Riley: </b>Like different endings? </p><p><b>Jane:</b> No not different endings, but different paths to the same end. That’s what I was wondering, but I think in fact it does probably pretty much direct you. I think probably 90% of people take more or less the same path through. </p><p><b>Riley:</b> The people who made that game also made another game called The Stanley Parable, where you walk around this empty office building and it’s sort of a mystery, and the little things you do like picking up a pad of paper or going into the wrong cubicle will completely change the game. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Jane: </b>That’s what I was wondering, if that was the case, but actually I don’t think so. </p><p><b>Riley: </b>This one does just have one outcome. </p><p><b>Jane: </b>Cool. Cool cool! </p>
