<p>Shovel Knight is an excellent 2014 indie game funded on Kickstarter and released on Steam, as well as all current Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo consoles. &nbsp;With its old-school 16-bit art style, Shovel Knight takes inspiration from nostalgic-ridden games of the past, while simultaneously boasting interesting characteristics that you could only find in a modern game.<b><br></b></p><p>You play as the titular Shovel Knight, a blue-clad warrior using his shovel to dig and slash. You can also use it to bounce off of things, akin to a pogo stick. &nbsp;This makes his movement charming, yet complex and challenging to master. &nbsp;He aims to rescue his comrade (and love interest) Shield Knight; the story is not artful by any stretch, but memorable characters and oddly heartfelt dream sequences make up for the game’s simple narrative.</p><p>Shovel Knight is presented beautifully: its art style complements its vast worlds, while its stellar chiptune soundtrack fits perfectly with every moment of the ~10 hour game. &nbsp;Shovel Knight’s music almost sounds orchestral, despite the fact that it’s composed within the sound limitations of old console games. &nbsp;This game has a better presentation than plenty of others out there today, making the whole game an immersive adventure. &nbsp;</p><p>The gameplay, though, is where Shovel Knight really excels. This atypical platformer requires that you navigate through long stages and worlds, defeating enemies along the way, and often using those enemies to your advantage when reaching certain areas. &nbsp;Many sections, for example, require that you shovel-pogo off of a certain enemy to scale a wall. Tough and masterful action sequences that will undoubtedly take a few tries to finish are scattered throughout each of these levels. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The game also has a deep upgrade system which complements Shovel Knight’s combat. &nbsp;Collect gold and treasure throughout the stages to purchase upgrades and side-weapons (or ‘Relics’). &nbsp;Each one of these Relics is unique, and contributes something fun to your arsenal. &nbsp;Many Relics seem useless, such as the heavy Fishing Rod, but can be implemented in creative ways to get treasure or more upgrades. &nbsp;I also loved the characters which provide these upgrades, especially the Troupple King. &nbsp;This half-trout, half-apple fish king provides you with potions to fill your health and magic bars. &nbsp;The Troupple King has a somewhat religious following amongst the villagers, and even Shovel Knight himself can become a “Troupple Acolyte”. &nbsp;</p><p>Another thing to note is the Feats, achievements that you can pursue as a little diversion throughout the game. &nbsp;These range from the hilarious, to the difficult, to the hilariously difficult. &nbsp;One requires that you listen to all of a villager’s puns (ex. “Don’t throw in the TROWEL!”). &nbsp;Another one tasks you with beating the game without dying. &nbsp;These add another layer of depth to the gameplay, encouraging you to use the tools you’re given (no pun intended) in interesting ways.</p><p>What makes Shovel Knight stand out from both older and newer games like it, besides its off-the-wall characters, are the unique strides it takes to make sure you are engaged in the game. &nbsp;Shovel Knight features no tutorials. &nbsp;Instead, after a cutscene outlining the story of the game, Shovel Knight throws you right into the first stage. &nbsp;You are &nbsp;expected to learn how to do things like dig and shovel-pogo yourself, without tutorials to interrupt the pace of the game. I wish more games would do this. In Shovel Knight, you are the only one propelling the game forward, and it assists you in challenges, rather than commanding them of you.</p><p>Shovel Knight is a game filled with personality. &nbsp;It’s charming, yet engaging and powerful in its execution. &nbsp;Shovel Knight doesn’t take itself too seriously, either, which is refreshing for a fantasy game. &nbsp;Every character, stage, and event is memorable. &nbsp;It may be a little short for its price tag, but that is the only real flaw in a very fun game. &nbsp;I would recommend Shovel Knight.</p>
