<h1>Our Favorite Albums of 2015</h1>
<h2>By Jacob Norman, Cody Burawski, Chan Benicki, Jay Hatcher, and Riley DeHority </h2>

<p>Music sure is great! You know what else is great? Sharing is great. We decided it would be fun to share with you our favorite musical releases of 2015. The following list of releases are accompanied with links to find the albums online. Some of them are also paired with us trying to describe the music in words or pictures. Hopefully you can find a new album which you’ll love or maybe you’ll just enjoy hearing us attempt to describe music we like. </p><p>JACOB’S FAVORITES: </p><p>"In the basement with..." by Kitten Crisis</p><p><a href="https://kittencrisis.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-basement-with">https://kittencrisis.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-basement-with</a></p><p>Kitten Crisis writes music that is about as cute as the name suggests. This 6 song EP is filled with catchy hooks, fun drums, and rocking bass. What this album lacks in length it makes up for in melody. Every track makes you want to sing along before you've even learned the words. From the simple harmonies at the end of the first track to the crisp horns on the album’s closer, if you miss summer I recommend closing your eyes and listening to "In the basement with..."</p><p>“asdfasdf” by katie dey<br><a href="https://katiedey.bandcamp.com/album/asdfasdf">https://katiedey.bandcamp.com/album/asdfasdf</a></p><p>I would describe this album as an artificial intelligence pleading with the angels to be allowed into heaven. I don’t say this because that is what the lyrics are about, (because frankly all of the singing on this album is mostly unintelligible) but rather because that is the set of emotions “asdfasdf” evokes. If you are craving an album with some fascinating texture in the vein of Alex G with hints of My Bloody Valentine, then look no further! </p><p>“Momentary Lapse of Happily” by adult mom<br><a href="https://adultmom.bandcamp.com/album/momentary-lapse-of-happily">https://adultmom.bandcamp.com/album/momentary-lapse-of-happily</a></p><p>Adult mom writes stellar lyrics about being sad, growing older, and struggling to be a person who lives up to their own values. As an example, in the song Survival, songwriter Stephanie Knipe sings, “Maybe in a year, I will not feel like a bad queer.” All of these lyrics are playfully sung over fairly sparse yet effective instrumentation. Overall, this album is a little like a blanket on a cold day.</p><p>~Jacob Norman</p><p>RILEY’S FAVORITES: </p>

<h4>Porch Cat's Bedroom Artist, a visual review by Riley DeHority</h4>

<p>Bedroom Artist, by Porch Cat </p><p><a href="https://porchcat.bandcamp.com/album/bedroom-artist">https://porchcat.bandcamp.com/album/bedroom-artist</a> </p><p>All Alone Together, by Xania </p><p><a href="https://xania.bandcamp.com/">https://xania.bandcamp.com/</a> </p><p>Reddishness, by Girls Rituals </p><p><a href="https://blacksquares.bandcamp.com/album/reddishness">https://blacksquares.bandcamp.com/album/reddishness</a> </p><p>CODY’S FAVORITES: </p><p>“No Answer to Be Found” by Mafdet</p><p><a href="https://mafdet.bandcamp.com/album/no-answer-to-be-found">https://mafdet.bandcamp.com/album/no-answer-to-be-found</a></p><p>No Answer To Be Found is a beautiful study on quantifying and maintaining one’s individual identity within the context of a romantic relationship. It’s essentially a solo album, but so many instruments are incorporated that is has a big, full-band vibe. The lyrics are smart, concise, and rich in imagery, delivered with wonderfully bluesy, dynamic vocals. There’s a great balance between powerful tracks full of enthusiastic trumpet and driving banjo riffs, and warm, thoughtful, sleepy songs peppered with sweet violin and xylophone harmonies. In just a few short songs No Answer To Be Found seamlessly transitions through a wide range of emotions and experiences, landing in a warm nostalgia that glows long after the last track is finished.</p><p>“Dig Me a Grave” by Dérive</p><p><a href="https://derive.bandcamp.com/album/dig-me-a-grave">https://derive.bandcamp.com/album/dig-me-a-grave</a> </p><p>Everything Dérive does is like a good soup where like, it's got tons of stuff in it and you really sort of have no idea what you're eating and you probably are going to have to read the ingredient list to figure it out, and it's probably got lots of spices you're not used to that are kind of overwhelming in a good way and a bunch of vegetables that you didn't like as a kid and are surprised to find yourself appreciating a bunch now. I really admire things with intricate structures that feel generated by the emotions they're expressing as opposed to the other way around. The lyrics are a very raw stream of consciousness with a dynamic, driving electric backdrop, like a one person play with a full orchestra.</p><p>“Now I Know You and See How Wide You Are To The World” by Loone and Paper Bee</p><p><a href="https://paper-bee.bandcamp.com/album/now-i-know-you-and-see-how-wide-you-are-to-the-world">https://paper-bee.bandcamp.com/album/now-i-know-you-and-see-how-wide-you-are-to-the-world</a> or</p><p><a href="https://loone.bandcamp.com/album/now-i-know-you-and-see-how-wide-you-are-to-the-world">https://loone.bandcamp.com/album/now-i-know-you-and-see-how-wide-you-are-to-the-world</a></p><p>"Now I Know You and See How Wide You Are To The World" is a split too musically and emotionally expansive to be contained within a normal length title. Loone's grand, cinematic use of a recurring pantheon of natural images is utilized in a way that remains deeply personal, weaving entire environments anchored by familiar themes like love, loss, and home. Paper Bee's half is similarly epic, merging folk and pop in a striking, uplifting and powerful series of songs that are bursting with vitality from start to finish. The lyrics are wonderfully elaborate - each track is a fascinating self contained story, like vignettes from a diary set to music. Really, this whole thing is perfect.</p><p>Chan’s Favorites: </p><p>1. Painted Shut - Hop Along [<a href="https://hopalong.bandcamp.com/">bandcamp</a>]</p><p>This year I got to see Hop Along live. I cried. Frances Quinlan (vocals &amp; guitar) is a huge inspiration to me vocally and lyrically, and I have been obsessed with this album since it came out in May. This album is definitely my most played album of the year. While I loved Get Disowned for the obvious DIY, track building feel of the music, Painted Shut feels more like Hop Along live. It’s put together, it’s tight, but it’s full of those scratchy vocals and bizarre melody lines, and honestly, that’s my favorite part. It’s so cool to hear it so clearly this time around. I could listen to it forever and keep finding new things to fall in love with. </p><p>Fav tracks: Buddy in the Parade, Happy to See Me, Texas Funeral, Sister Cities</p><p>2. New Teeth - High Dive [<a href="https://highdivetheband.bandcamp.com/">bandcamp</a>]</p><p>Okay. High Dive is one of those bands that I wasn’t expecting, but with Toby Foster, Ginger Alford, Ryan Woods, and others on the record, it’s easy to want to/have to listen to this album over and over. I’ve always been a Toby Foster fan, and this album was exactly the kind of album I have been wanting to hear from him. Upbeat, sometimes heavy with feeling, but overall very cathartic as any good pop-punk should be. If you’ve been needing a great queer-positive pop-punk band, this is the album you need to get your hands on (and it’s free on bandcamp!). </p><p>Fav tracks: Sirens, Coffee and Ice Water</p><p>3. Ivy Tripp - Waxahatchee [<a href="http://www.waxahatcheemusic.com/">website</a>]</p><p>When I first listened to Ivy Tripp, I was like, “Well this is new.” Some of the tracks carry a big 80’s ballad feeling plus some DIY drum beats with it, which surprisingly blends well with the dreamy pop-rock of Waxahatchee. I was worried I was going to miss what felt like Waxahatchee to me - the dream states of smoking in bathrooms on humid summer nights - but this album pulled me in and gave me what I needed regardless. While it’s not nearly as intimate feeling as past Waxahatchee albums, it’s got a lot of power and Katie Crutchfield’s gentle and soothing voice soars over the fuzzy guitars. It’s eclectic, and I like that.</p><p>Fav tracks: Under a Rock, Summer of Love, Air</p><p>JAY’S FAVORITES: </p><p>Look Up, bu Mod Sun </p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/modsun/sets/look-up">https://soundcloud.com/modsun/sets/look-up</a> </p><p>New Glow, by Matt and Kim</p><p><a href="http://www.mattandkimmusic.com/music/new-glow/">http://www.mattandkimmusic.com/music/new-glow/</a> </p><p>You Look A Lot Like Me, by Mal Blum </p><p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/0vC8oyFtm4SfIeknUAHfMl?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open">https://play.spotify.com/album/0vC8oyFtm4SfIeknUAHfMl</a> </p>
