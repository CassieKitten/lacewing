<h1>Letters From Home: Starting a Magazine</h1>
<h2>By Riley DeHority</h2>

<p>Dear reader,</p><p>I need to brag for a second. &nbsp;I have cool friends. &nbsp;I have friends with interesting hobbies and interesting thoughts and interesting lives. &nbsp;Many of these friends live far away. &nbsp;And many of them would really like each other. </p><p>Unfortunately, most of my friends live very far away from each other and have never met. &nbsp;And more unfortunately, all of the great social media sites I usually use to keep up with them are becoming more and more commercialized, engaging in shady data selling deals and unethical business practices. &nbsp;For a long time, I have wanted a space to make and share art with my friends that was separate from social media and the uncomfortable feeling of being the “product.” </p><p>So I made one. &nbsp;Lacewing News is zine culture meeting blog culture, coded and hosted entirely by its own contributors. &nbsp;None of the writers or artists are professional, but they all want to make good content. &nbsp;Nobody is worrying about going viral, or beating social media at its own game (fast, fake news). &nbsp;We are all here to learn new skills, to share our art with each other, and to tell the stories that matter to us.</p><p>I’ve never coded a website before and I am new to Photoshop, so it has been slow going, but I am very proud of what everyone has accomplished in the four short weeks since I announced the project. &nbsp;I’m still not sure what it will look like, but here are some of the columns proposed by contributors:</p><ul><li>Let’s All Play (Lots of people play a free video game and review it together)<br></li><li>Letters from Home (Personal essays in letter format)<br></li><li>Chrysopidae (Underground science news)<br></li><li>Moth Wing (Original poetry)<br></li><li>Drunk DIY (Like Pinterest, but with average art skills)<br></li><li>Man, Ew! [Middle America Never Eats Weirdstuff] (Reviews of strange convenience store food)<br></li></ul><p>Interspersed with these columns will be music and book reviews, interviews, and a comic section. It’s your neighborhood newsletter mixed with your college literary magazine mixed with what your facebook page WOULD look like, if your thoughtful posts were peer edited and well-illustrated. </p><p>I am not in charge of what this project becomes, and that is a new feeling for me. &nbsp;I am so excited to see what happens. </p><p>Love to all of you,</p><p>Riley DeHority</p><p>Morale Officer</p>
