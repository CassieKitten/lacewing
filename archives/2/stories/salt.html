<h1>Re: Salt - How Hot Was The Stove?</h1>
<h2>By Riley DeHority</h2>
<h3><i>But... you DID get data!</i></h3>

<p>Last month, our contributor Cal wrote up a neat kitchen science experiment testing whether salt water boiled faster than tap water. He took very careful measurements and replicated each test several times, only to conclude that “it doesn’t matter.”<br></p><p>Actually Cal, you got some cool data! After reading your article I started wondering what I could figure out just based off the data you provided (boiling point, volume of water and salt, boiling time, and start temperature)? </p><p>First, I had to put the data into a useable format. I calculated the average value for each amount of salt, and converted the units into something more useful. And the two cups of water used in each run equals 0.47 liters of water, which weighs 470g. Here’s the rest of my data:</p>

<h4>Cal's data in averages (and standard units)</h4>

<p>(5.2 tsp of salt is equal to one mole. A mole is 602214090000000000000000 atoms, which seems random, but it’s a very useful unit in chemistry. When you have a mole of something, its weight in grams equals its number on the periodic table.)</p><p>The first thing I wanted to know was the energy of your stove. We can figure that out using the data you got for zero salt. The temperature change for 470g of “pure” water was 79.5 K in 408 seconds. </p><p>Water changes temperature at a rate of, 4.2 kilojoules / kilogram Kelvin (for our purposes). In essence, adding heat is adding energy, and the relationship looks like this: </p><p>E = 4.2 m T </p><p>With our values, E = 4.2 x .47 kg x 79.5 K = 156.9 kilojoules. </p><p>E is energy, m is mass, and T is the change in temperature. We’re looking for the power of the stove, and power is energy divided by time. To get the wattage of the stove, we need to divide E by our value for time. </p><p>156.9 Joules / 408 seconds = 0.38 kilowatts. </p><p>This might seem small, but as Cal explained, he let the stove cool in between each test. The average small burner tops out at 1 kW, and if he started with a cold stove, with the wattage changing every second, then our equation only gives us an average wattage. (That energy equation up there is the total amount of energy sent from the stove to the water.) </p><p>An average of 380 watts doesn’t sound so strange, but we’re not done yet! &nbsp;Tune in next month if you’re curious about the thermodynamics of mixtures. </p>
