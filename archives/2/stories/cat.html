<h4>The yellow guitar by Riley DeHority</h4>

<p>In essence, the new Cat Be Damned album "all his empty show" is the experience of going to bed with a brain full of echoes of the daily grind and assorted worries, just at the point where these thoughts transition into dreams. Cat Be Damned really holds true to the fundamental core of bedroom pop, with lo-fi warmth, a drum machine, floaty synth, beach boys vocals, and subtle rumblings that invoke ancient nintendo driving games in the most sentimental way possible. The lyrics delve into interpersonal relationships and feelings pretty deeply, but maintain a consistent unbroken calm that carries through the entire piece. I would recommend this album for bus rides in the rain, and times where you're not drinking a smoothie but would like to imagine you are.</p>
