<h1>Letter From Home</h1>
<h2>By Riley DeHority</h2>
<h3><i>So what if I could be a wedding photographer??</i></h3>

<p>Dear friend,<br></p><p>Did you know that February is the shortest month out of the year? I forgot. If this month’s issue seems a little short, that’s why. If this was my day job, I probably wouldn’t have told you that. People try to avoid pointing out their own failures at their day jobs. </p><p>I’ve thought about the job vs. hobby thing a lot this month. School has been really hard, and even though I’m only a year from graduating, I constantly ask myself if I would be better off trying to make a living as an artist. I could probably manage… right? But my artist friends aren’t managing so well, and anyway, I do like school. Sometimes. I like reading Wikipedia articles about my schoolwork, at least. That means I like it, right? Do I even like art? It’s 11pm on the first of March and I am nowhere near finishing this issue of my art magazine. Should that tell me something? (Maybe it tells me that I do indeed have ADD.) </p><p>I love imagining the ways I might balance my work life and art life in the future. That’s one reason I’m excited to be done with school. Maybe if I didn’t have homework I could write more songs and teach myself to draw. Or maybe the urge to productively procrastinate (productinate?) wouldn’t be so damn overwhelming. </p>

<h4>My cute friends got literally married to each other.</h4>

<p>In other news, this past weekend my girlfriend and I flew up to Montreal to go to a wedding. I’ve never had friends get married before, and I had all of the required moments of personal existential angst, don’t worry. But the real weird part of this wedding (besides my friends being legally mandated by the Quebec civil code to cohabitate until they die) anyway the really weird part was that I did the photography. Why is that such a crisis? Because I think I did okay. I was prepared to do really bad, like I alway am with art. I love making bad art because it reminds me that I should probably stick to engineering school. &nbsp;But good art? That’s scary. That means I could be An Artist all day if I really wanted to. </p><p>I guess the moral of the story is: don’t give me a choice in life, or I will regret anything. </p><p>I hope you enjoy this month’s issue of Lacewing, but not too much! </p><p>-Riley </p><p></p>
