<h4>January 22nd, 2016 - Comic by Morgan Sea</h4>
</p>

<p>Greetings from Montreal,<b><br></b></p><p>This is your gal pal Morgan Sea, performance artist/illustrator and trans lesbian cat mom. I've always wanted to write and draw my own comic books, but struggle with my own high expectations. I want to practice and be good at drawing, but i also want things to be perfect right away. I'll think and think and overthink my ideas, until I totally lose interest in them. The whole process is a mess, honestly. </p><p>So I thought, this year for Fun-a-Day, I should just start a daily comic journal! <a href="http://fight-boredom.com/fun-a-day-mtl/">Fun-A-Day</a> is an month long event where you choose a project and work on it every day in January, then have a big group show in February! It was started in 2004 by the <a href="http://www.artclash.com/">Art-Clash Collective</a> in Philadelphia and it has since spread to cities across North America. I've been involved in Montreal's for the last 4 years and really dig it. January is pretty depressing honestly, so it's great for keeping motivated.</p><p>So yeah, to keep things fun, I'm trying to relax on quality and just document bits of my life in experimental comic formats. January is also a great time to start because I just moved in with my girlfriend Tali, so this will sort of be a story about our first month living together. I had actually moved in during mid-December, but a day after I did, Tali caught a plane to Victoria to visit her family. Shortly after, I traveled to Saskatoon to see my family and Tali flew in on Xmas day. So that's where our story begins, January 1st. </p>
