<h1>How To Make Patterns By Hand (DIY Tutorial)</h1>
<h2>By Zoe Pruitt</h2>

<p><b>Materials:</b><br>Paper<br>Any Drawing Utensil<br>Scissors <br>Ruler<br>Tape<br>Camera/ Scanner/ Copier</p><p>1. Take a piece of paper in any rectangular shape and start to draw in the middle. Don’t get too close to the sides because you’ll want the room later. </p>

<p>If you can’t think of anything to draw, you can look at patterns around your space. This pattern was inspired by the design on my teacup! </p><p>2. Once you fill the center, grab your ruler and scissors. I used measuring tape, but a metal or wooden ruler works much better. </p>

<p>-On the back of your paper, measure the length and width of the paper and make marks half way across. The more accurate you are during this step, the easier your work will be later!</p><p>-The back of your paper should end up segmented into four squares. Cut out the squares with your scissors. &nbsp;</p><p>3. Now you have four separate sheets of paper. In the image, I have labeled each sheet so that you can follow along. </p>

<p>-First, switch the locations of 1 and 4. Do not rotate the paper as you move it. Keep it in the same orientation.</p><p></p><p>-Switch the locations of 2 and 3.</p><p> </p><p>-You’ll know that you did it correctly when all of the edges that meet up are white (or whatever color your background is). </p><p>-Tape down the edges of the small sheets of paper so that they don’t move as you draw. Rather than tape them to one another, I recommend taping them to your workspace or something sturdy (ie. drawing pad, clipboard, etc.). </p><p>-Be sure to line up the edges as closely and accurately as possible. </p>

<p>4. Now draw in the middle again! Like before, you will want to avoid the edges because we will need the black space later. Take your time. Because the paper is cut into pieces it will be harder to draw on than before. </p>

<p>5. There should be four white spaces on the pattern- one on the top, one on the bottom, one on the left, and one on the right. We are going to fill those in now. Carefully, unstick your paper from your drawing space. </p>

<p>-Move 4 and 3 underneath 2 and 1. You should have a blank space in the center of the page. Re-secure the paper to the drawing space with tape and fill in the black space. </p>

<p>-Now switch the locations of 1 and 4. Switch the locations of 2 and 3. Again, you should have a blank space in the center of the page. Re-secure the paper to the drawing space with tape and fill in the black space. </p>

<p>6. Now that you have filled in the whole space- you have a repeating pattern! Good Job! From this point, you can do a number of things to see how your pattern repeats. </p>

<p>-You can scan your drawing and use a photo editing software to repeat the pattern. If the edges aren’t lining up correctly, you can use the clone stamp tool to make your edges blend into one another. </p><p>-If you aren’t proficient with a photo editing software, you can do the same things with a copier. If you take your pattern, copy it three times, cut off the white edges, and tape your four copies (including the original) together- you can see the full repeat! </p>
