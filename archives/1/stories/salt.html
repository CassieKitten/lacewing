<h4>Did they use salt to cook this faster? - Photograph by Riley DeHority</h4>

<p>Quick intro: I’ve wanted to do some home-based kitchen experiments for a while, but I haven’t gotten around to it. You know how it goes. Riley starting Lacewing is the perfect excuse for me to spend time on this stuff, so here we are.<b><br></b></p><p>My first experiment starts with this: I’ve always heard that salt makes water boil faster, but it doesn’t. A quick googling tells you that salt raises the boiling point of water, by increasing the required energy. In the same way, it also lowers the freezing temp. Basically, salt makes it harder for water the change states. </p><p>So why have I heard what I’ve heard? And what effect does salt have on boiling water anyway, in practical home cooking terms? Can I actually use salt to affect how my water boils? </p><p>Thus, the following experiment.</p><p>My experiment design:</p><p>Each test was me boiling two cups of water, with a meat thermometer resting in the water. I gradually upped the salt level on successive tests. </p><p>My method of adding the salt was the classic method of home cooks everywhere: add the water and salt, put it on the heat, let it alone. No stirring. I might’ve gotten different results if I’d mixed in the salt before heating the water, but I wanted to see how this method worked.</p><p>Between tests I let the burner cool, and rinsed the pot in cool water, so the leftover heat was gone.</p><p>My “boiling temp.” is the point when the thermometer stopped climbing (within half a degree), and my “boiling time” is the time it reached boiling temp., within about 5 seconds.</p><p>I recorded my starting temp., boiling time, and boiling temp. for each test, along with the amount of salt added.</p><p>Here’s my chart (one test per line):</p><p>

</p><p>Seems like a whole teaspoon of salt affects the boiling time by less than ten seconds (a 2-3% difference) and raised the boiling temp by ~1 degree (less than ½%).</p><p>There slight anomalies in each test group (marked green), but the variation is about 30 seconds max (“0.5 tsp 1” and “0.5 tsp 5” have a variance of 30 seconds, which is only about 7%), so I didn’t worry about it.</p><p>Soooooo basically my conclusion is this:</p><p>It doesn’t matter. Salt to taste. It won’t make any difference unless you’re sitting there with a stopwatch. Live your life.</p>
