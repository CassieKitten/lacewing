<h4>Galhalla’s first episode: “Person of Interest” - visual review by Riley DeHority</h4>

<p><b>Notes:<br></b></p><ul><li>The theme song literally gave me chills.<br></li><li>The host, Elisabeth Filmore, is extremely charming, with a soft stand-up vibe.<br></li><li>I am so excited to have found a podcast where the host says things like “It’s really weird, I have a really hard time liking men in shows.” Me too!<br></li><li>The interview was well-organized and full of laughter.<br></li><li>To my surprise, Galhalla is not a very critical show; at least in this episode, they only focus on what they love about the topic at hand (in this case, the television series Person of Interest). They also discuss the fandom in great detail.<br></li><li>The audience for this podcast is obviously people who are already familiar with the show, presumably folks in femslash communities online. Elisabeth did not waste much time explaining things to the audience; it felt like overhearing a conversation between two superfans. I couldn’t always follow the conversation, but that didn’t detract too much from my enjoyment.<br></li><li>My biggest critique of this episode is the poor audio quality, especially the distracting skips. It’s hard to tell if the microphone just made a lot of noise or if the clipping sounds come from editing. In the end that’s a big compliment to the sound editor; I can’t really tell if you cut things out at all.<br></li><li>I would also suggest keeping both voices an equal distance away from the microphone.<br></li><li>Near the middle of the show, the guest Max discusses “breaking” one of the show’s characters in his fanfiction. I couldn’t tell if this was insider lingo or a fantasy about… torturing someone, maybe? It left me slightly confused and disturbed, and I kept waiting for Elisabeth to put it in context. Maybe I just missed something. &nbsp;<br></li><li>Besides these small distractions, I enjoyed the show quite a bit. It was uplifting and fun, and gave me great ideas about things to watch and read. Plus they have a book club! &nbsp;I am looking forward to Galhalla Episode 2.<br></li></ul><p>Find Galhalla online: </p><p><a href="https://galhalla.wordpress.com/">https://galhalla.wordpress.com/</a> </p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-806379314">https://soundcloud.com/user-806379314</a> </p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/galhallapodcast/">https://www.facebook.com/galhallapodcast/</a> </p>
