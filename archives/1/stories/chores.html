<p>Do you always struggle to get dishes done and pick things up from your floor? I know I do. It’s hard work for anyone to keep things clean, but depression and chronic illnesses can make even the simplest chores seem impossible, even if you really want to do them. But having a clean home is nice, and you deserve nice things. Here are some suggestions for low-energy ways to keep your home clean. Everyone has different abilities and priorities, but maybe a few of these tips are applicable to your situation:<b><br></b></p><ol><li>Food waste is a priority. Clothes, papers, even dirt, are ok to leave around for a while, but if you leave food out it attracts bugs and might even spoil. If you only have energy for one task, focus on dealing with dishes or other food messes.<br></li><li>If you have a problem with procrastinating on doing dishes, try this tip to keep them from piling up: only use one plate, bowl, and silverware set. When it’s time to eat a meal, all you have to do is rinse the one plate and maybe wash off a spoon. This doesn’t work so well if you share dishes with roommates or have people over.<br></li><li>Instead of trying to clean your whole house or a whole room, try organizing one small area at a time. This might just mean throwing out the receipts in your handbag or picking up a few shirts from the floor.<br></li><li>Sweeping is hard. There’s bending over involved, there’s like a whole separate plastic item (the dustpan) to keep track of, and then sometimes you run out of energy and you just leave a pile of dirt on the floor. I have a $30 vacuum from Walmart that works on hard floor and carpet. If you have the cash, I suggest finding something similar. The biggest drawback: long hair gets stuck in it really easily.<br></li><li>Instead of buying sponges for like $5 from the grocery store, get the 5 for $1 kind that you can throw out when they get really gross.<br></li><li>Do you like taking baths? Personally I hate them, but I hate them more when there’s a bunch of dust and dirt around the tub. But scrubbing a bathtub? That’s a hard chore. I have two suggestions for making it easier:<br></li><ol><li>After taking a shower, grab a wad of toilet paper and wipe down the edges of the tub. Because the room has gotten steamed up, the dust and crud comes off more easily. Then just flush it down the toilet! You don’t have to do the whole tub at once, either.</li><li>After taking a bath, put some bleach powder or liquid in with your bathwater. You can spend a little bit of time scrubbing, or just mix it in and know that your tub has less bacteria living in it. Do NOT do this with bath bombs or similar products -- you don’t know how they will react with bleach.</li></ol><li>Do you have a weird pile of random tupperware somewhere? Tupperware sucks to take care of, but it is also very useful. i find it way easier to only have one type of tupperware, for example, ONLY keeping washed out yogurt tubs or ONLY keeping plastic takeout containers. I also have one of those huge ones for big pots of stuff that I cook. That way every top matches every bottom.<br></li><li>As for laundry: it’s possible that the people in your life might notice if you wear an article of clothing a few days in a row. &nbsp;But unless you get your clothes very dirty or sweaty in a single day, it’s probably OK to wear things a few times before washing them.<br></li><li>This is similar to #8: &nbsp;if you live alone, nobody else should care what your home looks like. Focus on tasks that you want to have done, not on what someone else would do. Is the dust really bothering you, but you don’t really care if there are papers everywhere? Then dust! (One big caveat -- if you live with kids or dependents, then you really need to focus on possible health hazards to them.)<br></li><li>If you have roommates, tell them about what’s easy for you, and what’s really hard. Communicate your wants, needs, and abilities. Ask about theirs. It’s cheesy, but teamwork can make a big difference. &nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>Hopefully this list gave you some ideas about ways to clean your home that don’t cost too many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">spoons</a>. This stuff is harder than people admit, so I wish you the best of luck. </p>
