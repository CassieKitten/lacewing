<h1>Letter from Our Uncertain Future</h1>
<h2>By Riley DeHority</h2>

<p>Hey y’all!<b><br></b></p><p>Is it just me, or did March seem really long this year? I know that a lot of Lacewing contributors stayed extra busy with personal projects this month, and I was swamped with school work. At least, I was swamped with anxiety about being swamped with work. Is there a difference?</p>

<p>But in between studying and worrying about studying, I have picked up a new interest. It might sound a little out there, but I have gotten into prepping. That's short for preparing, as in preparing for natural disasters.</p>

<p>This is how it started: a few weeks ago, I came across a blog run by a sweet-looking mom and her two kids. It was all about food storage, first aid, disaster preparedness, gardening, and taking care of your disabled family members if the social systems you rely on fail. She called herself the Survival Mom, and even though I disagreed with some of her opinions (the ones about guns and the definition of “cheap”), for the first time, the prepper attitude didn’t seem so far-fetched. It seemed… logical!</p>

<p>Like, it makes total sense that you would keep a little bit of water stored in your house in case the running water doesn’t work one day! Of course you should keep a few cans of food around if you can, and know how to do basic first aid! Carrying a few days’ worth of prescriptions in your purse is a great way to be sure you’ll never be stranded without them. Some of the things she wrote about were so damn sensible. I found myself taking what she calls “baby steps,” like filling up 2-liter soda bottles with tap water and keeping a few under the sink, and buying a paper map of my town in case Google fails us one day. Nothing major, no big purchases, just a little bit of organizing and a lot of reading. </p>

<h4>They call them bug-out bags.</h4>

<p>I really liked her disdain for macho apocalypse guys who stock up on ammunition and liquor, who seem creepily excited about fending for themselves and defending their backyard bunkers against the hungry sheeple. Of course, those guys can do what they want, and maybe their forty extra propane tanks will come in handy someday. But prepper mom culture tries to focus on small goals, and taking care of the people you love. </p>

<h4>And the plants you love.</h4>

<p>One issue I have with this culture is their ideas about money, since most of them seem to be well-off stay at home moms. &nbsp;They tend to say things like “I bought this solar oven on a whim, it was only $600!” &nbsp;Especially when they talk about prepping as “the responsible thing to do.” I have a problem with the mentality that you are responsible for your own wellbeing. I think we are all responsible together, and if someone tells you otherwise, they aren’t taking into account the amount of other people who make their life livable, like the people who pave roads, and the people who harass them into getting flu shots. Independence is a dangerous myth. But so is the stability of our society. I like feeling prepared, at least mentally, for a sea change. &nbsp;</p>
