<h1>Is this place real?</h1>
<h2>By Cody Burawski</h2>
<h3><i>Contributor Cody finds a new place in Chapel Hill, NC</i></h3>

<p>So, I'm on the bike trail by my house, and see a big cliff with a steep trail leading up it, and a little sign with a picture of a coffee cup at the bottom. I'm kinda dehydrated and need wifi to check my map, so, huffing and puffing, I decide to climb up. It turns out to be a windy trail, that becomes significantly more groomed and transitions into a series of stairs as I get closer to the top. I keep passing very well dressed people sunning themselves on the rocks, most wearing stylish sunglasses. I discover a series of patios built into the hillside, and a very tiny, unimaginably cute building, with a strong scent of freshly ground coffee wafting out. There are all sorts of delicately structured rock formations surrounding the little cafe, and all of the people on the patio seem so attractive and happy that they look like movie extras.<br></p>

<p>Usually I have a low tolerance for cuteness when it comes to coffee shops. I get self conscious in a coffee shop that's too cute and stylish, like maybe this coffee shop is judging me for not being cuter, or more stylish. But this one is different: I'm shamelessly drawn in, in my ripped off-brand converses and cat-hair-dusted yoga pants, reeking of bike ride armpit, and bask. It's very rustic and tiny, and the walls are covered in bottles of fancy wine I don't understand. I cannot find a menu. A single pink carnation floats in a glass of water on the counter.</p><p>The baristas emanate so much kindness. Both of them look exactly like Pat The Bunny, and they are both laughing and joking with each other, appearing to be genuinely comfortable and happy in their place of work. Amazing. </p><p>I find a menu on the counter and, after examining the flavor list, I order a blackberry iced coffee. This is a coffee shop where when you order iced coffee they say "is an iced americano okay?" and you pretend to know what that means and say yes, so I actually order a blackberry iced americano. It's three dollars but like, whatever, I had that coming. The baristas give the person ahead of me their order. It's a pile of vanilla ice cream with some fine chestnut colored powders on it. The barista delicately pours a creamer cup of mysterious syrup that might be espresso onto the ice cream. I am baffled but understand that I have witnessed something sacred. </p><p>When my order appears, the barista calls out a "black and blue". I ask if this is the blackberry americano and Pat The Bunny #1 says they decided to call it that just now. Pat The Bunny #2 compliments them on their creativity and laughs, they laugh together. It is so charming I could weep. </p><p>Now, as I write this, I'm relaxing on a bench on the cliffside overlooking the Bolin Creek, drinking my blackberry iced americano (which is particularly good, they were very generous with the blackberry syrup but it’s not more sugary than it should be), feeling as though I've ascended to the heavens and am frolicking in the playground of the gods. Caffe Driade is most likely not real. </p><p>There is a normal parking lot out front that connects to East Franklin Street, and the front of the building is handicap accessible, so climbing a dirt path up a hillside off a bike trail is not a prerequisite for visiting.</p><p>5/5 stars if you can handle the majesty of it all. Not as many stars if you’re just looking for a cheap cup of coffee to go, though I’m not sure what portion of the cost of mine was from the flavor shot.</p><p>Extra update: beautifully layered choral hymnals are now emerging from an unknown source on the upper patio</p>
