##Proposed list of tasks
As thought up by @Gersande

* Create a css folder to organize css files 
* Go through all hyperlinks and make sure relative folder paths work properly 
* If Gersande has a little bit of extra time, they volunteer to fix up a little bit of the CSS and organize it a little bit. But only if Riley says it's okay! 
* Add dates to the archives.html page (so that underneath Issue 1, Issue 0, there's a date of publication because otherwise it's hard to tell when things where published)
